# FanSpeedControl
This code allows you to control multiple computer fans with the use of an app.
The fans are controlled by bluetooth and can be used both individually and together at the same time.
This code is easily expandable and simple to add more fans.
This base code allows you to control up to 3 fans.

To use this, you must have download the app which was created in MitAppInventor and should be in the same folder as this file. The file is called Fan Speed Controller.apk.

Once you have it installed to your phone, you must next upload the Arduino code to an Arduino Uno board.

Next you must connect a bluetooth module to the Arduino board.

Next using the app, you click on the bluetooth button to connect to the bluetooth module.

Once you are connected, you must next connect the computer fans to the Arduino and also connect their ground and power to an external power supply. You must allow connect a pin wire for each of the fans which should be the blue wire of the fan.

Once you have properly connected the wires to the pins and to the power and ground, you may turn on the power supply.

Now using the sliders of each fan, you will be able to control the speeds of each of the fans.
